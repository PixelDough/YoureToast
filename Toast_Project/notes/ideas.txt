Story:
	A scientist gave life to a piece of toast, and is putting it through test trials. However, the toast
	escapes and goes with Mac, the lab assistant, who must conduct the scientist's tests over the phone.

Doc: Eurika! I did it! I gave life to a piece of toast!
Mac: Uh, doc... Why a piece of toast?
Doc: I was hungry... Anywho, check it out.
Doc: Oh, I should open that door for it. It seems to want to get in that toaster.
