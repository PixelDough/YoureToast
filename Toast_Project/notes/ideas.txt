Story:
	A scientist gave life to a piece of toast, and is putting it through test trials. However, the toast
	escapes and goes with Mac, the lab assistant, who must conduct the scientist's tests over the phone.
	Eventually, after returning to the lab and conducting a few more experiments with Doc, Mac must take
	the Toast into outer-space for the final tests.

Doc: Eurika! I did it! I gave life to a piece of toast!
Mac: Uh, doc... Why a piece of toast?
Doc: I was hungry... Anywho, check it out.
Doc: Oh, I should open that door for it. It seems to want to get in that toaster.

Mac: Hey Doc, why do you always work in the Lab?
Doc: You should always conduct experiments where you feel most comfortable, my apprentice!
Mac: So... Like sailing on the open sea?
Doc: If that's what FLOATS YOUR BOAT! Ha ha ha ha!
