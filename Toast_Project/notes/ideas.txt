Story:
	A scientist gave life to a piece of toast, and is putting it through test trials. However, the toast
	escapes and goes with Mac, the lab assistant, who must conduct the scientist's tests over the phone.
	Eventually, after returning to the lab and conducting a few more experiments with Doc, Mac must take
	the Toast into outer-space for the final tests. However, upon arriving in space, Doc reveals his evil
	plot. He was made fun his science fair project on toast, so he is making a super-toaster that will 
	turn everybody in the world into toast.
