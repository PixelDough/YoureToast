---Chapter 1: The Lab---
Doc: Eurika! I did it! I gave life to a piece of toast!
Kid: Uh, doc... Why a piece of toast?
Doc: I was hungry... Anywho, check it out.
Doc: Oh, I should open that door for it. It seems to want to get in that toaster.

Doc: Let's put our toasty friend to the test.
Kid: What are those striped blocks?
Doc: They are loose and will fall if the toast's weight is put on it.
Kid: I see... I hope it doesn't crush itself...
Doc: Don't worry, if anything bad happens, or the toast get's stuck, I can just restart the test for it.

Kid: Hey, if it keeps going in that toaster, won't it get all dark and burnt?
Doc: I thought about that. I removed the toasting mechanisms from the toaster so that doesn't happen.
Kid: Oh, okay. Why do you think the toast wants to get inside the toaster?
Doc: I'm sure it's some sort of instinct.

Kid: Hey Doc, why do you always work in the Lab?
Doc: You should always conduct experiments where you feel most comfortable, my apprentice!
Kid: So... Like sailing on the open sea?
Doc: If that's what FLOATS YOUR BOAT! Ha ha ha ha!

Doc: Hm...
Kid: What is it, Doc? Is something wrong?
Doc: No, I'm just thinking... Could you take the toast home with you tonight? I want to see how it reacts
to a different environment.
Kid: Uh... Er... I don't know... How about -
Doc: Jolly good show! I'm heading out, call me if you need help running the tests!
Kid: I guess it's just you and me, little guy...


---Chapter 2: The Kitchen---
Kid: I can't believe he wants ME to do the tests... This wasn't in the job description...
Doc: *riiiiiing riiiiiing*
Kid: Oh hey Doc, I just got my first test set up... I don't think I'm ready for this...
Doc: Oh nonsense! It's as simple as Peanut Butter and Jelly!
Kid: Jelly... I wonder if the little guy eats jelly!
Doc: I'm sure it'll jump for joy after trying it!

Kid: It seems that, when eating STAWBERRY JELLY, the toast can jump in the air more.
Doc: Incredible observation! Write down any observations you make in a notebook!
Kid: Oh, okay, let me go find one...

Kid: Those spikes look painful... Can they hurt him? Are you sure our little friend is okay?
Doc: Of course!
Kid: Um... Which part were you saying "of course" to?
Doc: ...
Kid: ...

Kid: This is really stressfull... I don't feel like I'm building these tests properly...
Doc: Try to relax. You'll get the hang of it! Practice makes perfect!
Kid: Okay... What is the data from these tests being used for?
Doc: Just, uh... Toast related things I guess.

Kid: Hey Doc, you said to do tests where I feel most comfortable, right?
Doc: Yes, while we were at the lab!
Kid: I always feel so calm when I'm on the open sea. Can I do the tests there?
Doc: I don't see why not! Just don't let the toast get too soggy! Ha ha ha!


---Chapter 3: The Sea---
Kid: Ah, I haven't been on my boat since the rumors of pirates in the area!
Doc: If you lose signal, don't forget to write down all your findings, you can always tell me back
at the lab! Also, I wan-- you ---- in ---------
Kid: Perfect timing, must have just lost signal.
*loud crash and screenshake*
Kid: What was that? Oh... Oh no... Pirates...

Kid: Can we please just settle this... Peacefully?
Pirate: Peaceful! Har har har! We can talk about peace once you empty yer pockets!
Kid: But I don't have any gold or anything!
Pirate: Then hand over that curiosity you seem so interested in...
Kid: (The experiment!)
Pirate: I guess I'll have to take it by force! Tie the boy up in me quarters, I'll grab the tank!

Pirate: What be this... Somebody made a living toast? Har har har!
Kid: Yes, well, you see, I have to run some tests, and if you could just-
Pirate: Nobody tells THE GREAT BLACKBROW what to do! One more peep like that and you'll 
walk the plank!

Pirate: Is this toast valueble, or be it a waste of BLACKBROW's time?
Kid: Uh... I don't know how valueble it is... Doc only just made it!
Pirate: Tell me where I can find this... Doc...
Kid: I really shouldn't...
Pirate: Oh really? I guess you can tell it to Davey Jones! Take him to the plank, men!

Kid: Please don't do this! Just let me go and I'll never bother you! I'll sail right home!
Pirate: I can't have no prawn on the land blabberin' about us... It's off the deck with you!
Kid: Okay, but don't throw the tank in! I don't know how water will effect the toast!
Pirate: Har har har, ye don't know when to stop talkin'! Off the plank!
